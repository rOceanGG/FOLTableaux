Given either a First Order Logic statement or a Propositional Logic statement, this program uses a tree data structure to determine if the statement is satisfiable and hence, can determine if a statement is valid (if we can find Â¬P to not be satisfiable, then we have found P to be valid). The only current limitation is that I introduce a maximum of 10 new variables. However, this limit can be changed to a higher value, should it be needed.
